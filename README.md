## About the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative
The Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) is driven by the mission to enable collection, preservation and accessibility of information— image files, textual annotation, and metadata—concerning all ancient Near Eastern artifacts inscribed with cuneiform. With over 334,000 artifacts in our catalogue, we house information about approximately two-thirds of all sources from cuneiform collections around the world. Our data are publicly available at https://cdli.ucla.edu, and our audience comprises primarily scholars, students, museum staff, and informal learners. 

Through its long history, CDLI is now integral to the Assyriological discipline fabric itself. It is used as a tertiary source, a data hub and a research data repository. Based on Google Analytics reports, CDLI's website is visited on average by 3,000 monthly users in 10,000 sessions and 100,000 pageviews. 78% of these users are recurring visitors. The majority of users access CDLI collections and associated tools seeking information about a specific text or group of texts; insofar as these are available to us, CDLI has authoritative records about where the physical document is currently located, when and where is was originally created and deposited in ancient times, what is inscribed on the artifact and where it has been published. Search results display artifact images and associated linguistic annotations when available.

CDLI is a collaboration of developers, language scientists, machine learning engineers and cuneiform specialists who are creating a software infrastructure to process and analyze curated data. To this effect, we are actively developing two projects: [Framework Update](https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=news/cdli-core-update) and [Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages](https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/). As part of these endeavors, we are building a natural language processing platform to empower specialists of ancient languages to undertake translation of Sumerian language texts, thus enabling data-driven study of the languages, culture, history, economy and politics of ancient Near Eastern civilizations. In this platform we are focusing on data normalization using Linked Open Data to foster best practices in data exchange, standardization and integration with other projects in digital humanities and computational philology.

To follow our research, see [an overview](https://cdli-gh.github.io/research_introduction.html) of the tools we use to track our work.

The CDLI offers catalogue and text data that are downloadable from our [Github data repository](https://github.com/cdli-gh/data), image files that can be simply harvested online or obtained on demand (including higher resolution images, for research purposes only), and textual annotations that are currently being prepared by the [MTAAC research team](https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/about/).

## Project Idea
This project seeks to develop a data visualization page containing different visuals about stats of our artifacts and textual data. The user will can control what type of data he/she wish to see. The overall idea about the workflow is that the required data would be extracted from database, processed in CakePHP controller and the passed to the view. The received data would then be used with a javascript visualization library like D3.js(recommended) or Chart js for displaying cool visuals.

Web standards and appropriate fallbacks are required to be taken care of for accessibility.

If time permits:
- Implementation of material design(materialize css) on the webpage

## Tasks:  
- Design content of the webpage
- Implement D3.js on webpage with static data.
- Deploy webpage in CakePHP.
- Integrate model with controller and view.
- Prepare documentation

## Skills required/preferred:
- Familiarity with HTML, CSS and JS.
- Familiarity with MVC design and PHP.
- Desire and eagerness to learn.
- Familiarity with JSON structured data.

## Your own project (bring 'em on!)
We are interested in expanding our technological capabilities in processing, analyzing and distributing (including visualization and accessibility) our catalogue and textual derived data. If you have an idea that could be reused either to reproduce your research or enhance further developments in the disciplines of Assyriology, Computational Linguistics or Computer Science, reach out to us and we can work together on preparing a project suitable for you, CDLI.
